[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/diagrams/diagrams-povray.png)](http://travis-ci.org/diagrams/diagrams-povray)

A rendering backend for three-dimensional
[diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams) generating
[POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) scene descriptions.  Currently, it
is not much more than a skeletal proof of concept, and is waiting for
an interested party to come along and flesh it out!
